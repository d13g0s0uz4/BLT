
If you are in a hurry, you should first open the generic "INSTALL.txt" file. 
This one will show you how to launch BLT in a single run instance. 

Otherwise, if you prefer to spend some time having BLT cleanly installed, 
on your MacBook (only tested on Yosemite so far),
then you came to the right place :-)


#####
### 0. Unzip the BLT package
You must have downloaded it from the NetFishers web site.
Extract the compressed archive to an installation directory, 
let's say blt-x.y.z

skip to step 2 if you already have Oracle JRE 8 or 7 installed

#####
### 1. Download and install Oracle JRE 8
Pick the proper version here : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
Install and check the running Java version :
 java -version
 This should give : java version "1.8.x"


#####
### 2. Create the SSL certificate
Execute keytool program in a terminal as follows :
 sudo keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore blt.jks -storepass password -validity 3600 -keysize 2048
 Press Enter when asked for a password.


#####
### 3. Install the files to their proper location
Copy the certificate (blt.jks file) into your installation directory.
Adapt your "blt.conf" file as needed : you may want to store the log messages in a dedicated file.
To do so, just change the "blt.log.file = CONSOLE" to provide the name of a log file in your install dir.

#####
### 4. Start BLT service
Start a terminal and go to your install dir.
Enter : 
 java -jar blt.jar
Now you should be able to log into BLT at: https://localhost:8443/
Use the account admin (password admin) for the initial login
then you can create more users in the Admin section.
