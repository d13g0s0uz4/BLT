If you are in a hurry, you should first open the generic "INSTALL.txt" file. 
This one will show you how to launch BLT in a single run instance. 

Otherwise, if you prefer to spend some time having BLT cleanly installed, 
on your Linux machine (Debian and Ubuntu have been tested so far), 
then you came to the right place :-)


#####
### 0. Unzip the BLT package
You must have downloaded it from the NetFishers web site.
Uncompress/untar the file.
 unzip blt-x.y.z.zip
 cd blt-x.y.z

skip to step 2 if you already have Oracle JRE 8 or 7 installed

#####
### 1. Download and install Oracle JRE 8
Using the PPA is probably the easiest way to go.

 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

If these commands are not available on your system (Debian), manually add the
source list and import the key. Follow the instructions on this page:
http://www.webupd8.org/2014/03/how-to-install-oracle-java-8-in-debian.html.

Check the running Java version:
 java -version 2>&1 | grep version
This should give 1.8.x


#####
### 2. Create the SSL certificate and a dedicated user without homedir

 sudo keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore blt.jks -storepass password -validity 3600 -keysize 2048
 
 !!! Press Enter when asked for a password !!!

 sudo useradd -M blt

#####
### 3. Install the files to their proper location

 Create the install dir and copy the certificate into it:

 sudo mkdir /usr/local/blt
 sudo mv blt.jks /usr/local/blt/

 sudo cp blt.jar /usr/local/blt
 sudo chmod 666 blt-data.xml
 sudo cp blt-data.xml /usr/local/blt
 
 sudo chown -R blt /usr/local/blt

 # if you don't want your data to be stored in /usr/local/blt
 # you can move "blt-data.xml" anywhere,
 # and then update "blt.dump.filename" entry in "blt.conf"

 sudo cp blt.init /etc/init.d/blt
 sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/blt
 sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/blt
 sudo mkdir /var/log/blt

 # Inside "blt.conf":
 # a lot of options can be changed in "blt.conf", just have a look into it.
 # You can create your personal "blt.conf" in your homedir
 # This takes precedence over /etc/blt.conf
 
 sudo cp blt.conf /etc/
 sudo chown root:root /etc/blt.conf

#####
### 4. Start BLT service

 sudo service blt start

Now you should be able to log into BLT at: https://localhost:8443/
Use the account admin (password admin) for the initial login
then you can create more users in the Admin section.

#####
### 5. Optional - Start BLT at bootup

 sudo update-rc.d blt defaults
