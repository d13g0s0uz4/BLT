RELEASE HISTORY:

0.3.2 - 2015-04-16 - The initial public release.
0.3.3 - 2015-04-19 - Add prefix add/withdraw monitoring capability
0.3.4 - 2015-07-20 - Add graphic monitoring capability:
                     - routers and prefixes turn green/orange/red upon announcement and withdrawal
                     - customizable timers in "blt.conf" blt.bgp.deltaNewIgpRoute and blt.bgp.deltaLostIgpRoute
                     Add age of routes in "prefix" tab
                     Elliptic layout of routers at launch
0.3.5 - 2015-11-21 - Add an auto refresh feature for real time RIB monitoring.
                     This can be toggle on/off from the main window toolbar. 
                   - Fix some bugs:
                     - now routers positions are saved in XML dumpfile as soon as the layout is updated
                     - SnmpPollingTask : we need to retrieve SNMP router hostname at least once when IGP is OSPF
0.4.0 - 2016-01-21 - Add support for Google maps layout
                     The switch from legacy view to Google maps is available in the main view
                     GPS coordinates from nodes are collected using SNMP OID sysLocation
                   - Fix some bugs: 
                     - problem with concurrent access to route history and state
                     - cosmetic things

0.4.2 - 2016-02-09 - Link cost revealed on mouseHover
				   - Support for IPv6 prefixes
				   - Support for GPS coordinates lookup using DNS LOC records (RFC 1876)
0.4.3 - 2016-03-10 - Dijkstra computation: 
                     - new REST primitive for shortest path computation towards a single node
                     - new REST primitive for shortest path tree rooted at a specific node
                     - shortest path visibility from Google Maps view
